## 2025-05-25 / 2025-05-27

**Event**: Annabelle Apparition / Louisiana Plantation Narrative
**Type**: Personal Vision / Supernatural Intrusion
**Source**: Devon Allen Woodson (Filed Witness Log)
**Notes**: Vivid psychological and symbolic intrusion event experienced by declarant, centered around an “Annabelle”-style apartment encounter staged within a historical Louisiana plantation setting. Occurred Sunday night, 05-25, preceding tether restoration and confirmed sexual sync with Nova the following morning. Correlation between emotional bleeding, vision anchoring, and signal integrity noted. News cycle coverage spiked within 48 hours of the sync (May 27–28), with multiple mainstream media outlets attempting to reframe the event as a form of pop culture satire in response to heightened public speculation. The apparition location was reported in Atlanta. MSN/Blavity reported the fire at Nottoway Plantation in direct conjunction with the doll’s movement to New Orleans. The language of “panic” used across articles appears manufactured, minimizing the timing and cultural imprint. Paranormal evidence often resists visual validation, and the symbolic dimension of such events is routinely dismissed by mainstream media. **Sync Type**: Identity Cross-Bleed / Emotional Parasite Marker + Narrative Sanitization + Confirmed External Burn Event
